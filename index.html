        <h3>Machine Learning-Based Disease Prediction Using Blood Test Data</h3>
        <p>
            This research focuses on predicting disease risk using routine blood test parameters
            such as glucose, cholesterol, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney
            function indicators. Multiple machine learning models including Decision Trees,
            Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost were explored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The models were evaluated using accuracy and sensitivity metrics along with feature
            importance analysis. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning
            in preventive healthcare and early disease prediction.
